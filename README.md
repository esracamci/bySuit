# bySuit

This is a Discord bot that allows you to split a deck of playing cards by suit, shuffles each subdeck, and deals cards one by one until the deck is depleted. It was created to facilitate playing <a href="https://buriedwithoutceremony.com/the-quiet-year/the-deep-forest">The Deep Forest</a> remotely, and may be useful for similarly structured games.

This bot is not currently hosted - to use replace 'YOUR-BOT-TOKEN' and run through command line.
